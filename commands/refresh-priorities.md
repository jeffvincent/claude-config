# Refresh Priorities Command

Analyze the last 90 days of Grove activity and refresh the `priorities.md` document in the Grove directory.

## Task

You are helping Jeff refresh his leadership priorities document based on recent activity in Grove.

**Location:** `/Users/jvincent/Projects/Work/HubSpot/Grove/priorities.md`

## Process

1. **Read current priorities.md** to understand what's currently documented

2. **Analyze recent Grove activity** (last 90 days):
   - Read `grove-notes.md` focusing on entries from the last 90 days
   - Sample 5-7 person files from `people/` directory, focusing on recent notes
   - Review `resources/PM-Coaching.md` for recent coaching patterns
   - Look for recurring themes, concerns, and focus areas

3. **Identify what's changed:**
   - New priorities that emerged
   - Priorities that have faded or been resolved
   - Shifts in emphasis or framing
   - New recurring concerns
   - What energizes/drains have changed

4. **Generate updated priorities.md:**
   - Replace the "Core Priorities" section with current top 10-12 priorities
   - Update "Recurring Concerns" based on what's actually recurring recently
   - Update "What Energizes Me" section
   - Update "Last Updated" date to today
   - Add a "What Changed Since Last Update" section at the top showing:
     - Date range analyzed
     - New priorities added
     - Priorities that dropped off or de-emphasized
     - Significant shifts in focus

5. **Present the changes** to Jeff:
   - Show a summary of what changed
   - Ask if he wants to commit the updated document
   - If yes, commit with a descriptive message noting key shifts

## Important Guidelines

- **Replace, don't just append** - if something isn't showing up in the last 90 days, it shouldn't be in the current priorities
- **Be specific, not generic** - use actual examples and quotes from recent notes
- **Keep it jargon-free** - use plain language, not corporate speak
- **Stay concise** - each priority should be 2-3 sentences max
- **Focus on patterns** - what comes up repeatedly, not one-off mentions
- **Maintain the energizing/honest tone** - this is a personal document, not a performance review

## Output Format

After analysis, show Jeff:

```
