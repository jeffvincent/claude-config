# Customer Feedback Call - Emma (HubSpot Admin at AX)

## Video
https://zoom.us/rec/share/abc123

## Call Summary

Emma is the main HubSpot admin at AX, where she's worked for 4 years (using HubSpot since 2015). She supports multiple departments and has seen significant evolution in how the company uses HubSpot - shifting from set marketing campaigns to operational projects focused on streamlining business processes.

The conversation focused on moments of disconnection Emma experiences in HubSpot, particularly where features don't integrate as expected or where data can't be used consistently across different areas. Three major pain points emerged: membership/registration management limitations, the disconnect between lists and views, and the isolation of the leads object from other HubSpot functionality.

These disconnections create significant time costs, force reliance on support for basic administrative tasks, and undermine HubSpot's core value proposition of unified data. Emma emphasized that these issues particularly impact administrators who work across multiple HubSpot areas and need to support various departments efficiently.

## Key Quotes

> "I had it was a proper panic moment for me, because we had our biggest dealer group about to resend. We were on a timeline for their campaign. And there was nothing like, I was completely powerless."
>
> — Emma, on being blocked by support limitations during a critical deadline

> "At the moment, I have to search for the person individually. And as I'm typing, it's constantly refreshing up and updating the list. So if I was to start, you can see I'm trying to put a space in and it's kind of jumping ahead of me."
>
> — Emma, demonstrating membership management interface issues

> "The membership list in and of itself, you can't apply filters over the top of it. It's very static. I can't add columns. I can't treat it like a wider segment. And I guess that's my thing with it."
>
> — Emma, on the limitations of membership management

> "I find myself sometimes in a view because I'm starting to investigate something, and I go, 'Great, I've got my little reference for my troubleshooting or something'. And then I end up going, 'Actually, I would like to make this a list. There's no option for me to go take these filters and put them in a list."
>
> — Emma, on views-to-lists conversion problems

> "Sometimes I don't fully understand why things don't go together. Another side disconnect is the leads object. I can't create lists from about leads. I feel very isolated with them. I don't use them because of that."
>
> — Emma, on the leads object isolation

> "It does sort of feel sometimes and, you know, with everything on this, like, left hand sidebar, it's so huge and disparate now that I mean, as an admin, I see everything. But it is easy to get a bit lost and not fully understand how things intersect with each other."
>
> — Emma, on HubSpot's growing complexity

> "Sometimes from a customer perspective, it can make you feel like HubSpot is almost getting too big, if you know what I mean. Like you would get in any large business, the moments of disconnect, they filter down to the customer, but it's almost like they're not being noticed at that higher level."
>
> — Emma, on her perception of HubSpot's scale

> "I mean, I find that everything takes longer. When I as an admin, I'm always happy to help people. But when I get asked for a view, and can you please create this for all of the teams? So they've got their own view. My heart sinks slightly, because I'm like, oh, no, and then they're all going to belong to me."

> — Emma, on the business impact of workflow inefficiencies

## Topical Breakdown

**00:00:00 - Introduction & Background**
Emma's HubSpot experience and current role as main admin at AX.

- Using HubSpot since 2015 (joined agency, saw many iterations)
- Main admin at AX for 4 years
- Reports to head of digital (John) who is backup admin
- Sole person with in-depth day-to-day portal knowledge

**00:00:30 - Portal Usage Evolution**
How Emma's use of HubSpot has shifted from marketing campaigns to operational projects.

- Business pivoted from set marketing campaigns to reactive marketing
- Now doing operational projects focused on streamlining processes
- Using HubSpot for business efficiency beyond traditional marketing
- Supporting multiple departments across the company

**00:02:57 - Issue #1: Memberships & Registration Management**
Cannot bulk manage registration emails for large membership lists, creating critical workflow bottlenecks.

- Training 2,000+ dealer groups via memberships (1,000 unregistered)
- Must manually resend registration emails one by one
- Search constantly refreshes while typing, jumping ahead
- Cannot filter membership lists or apply segments
- Requires HubSpot support for "hard reset" of properties
- Support dependency creates timeline risks during campaigns
- Cannot treat membership lists like regular segments (no columns, no filters)

**00:09:41 - Issue #2: Lists vs Views Disconnect**
Cannot convert views to lists or transfer ownership, forcing recreation and creating organizational chaos.

- No option to convert view filters into a list
- Must recreate all filters from scratch when switching
- Cross-object filtering only works in lists, not views
- Cannot transfer view ownership to team members
- Teams must clone views, creating numerous duplicates
- No visibility into view usage or last accessed date
- Difficult to clean up unused views without usage data

**00:12:25 - Business Impact & Workflow Consequences**
These disconnections create significant time costs and prevent proper portal management.

- Everything takes significantly longer
- Must impersonate users to create views in their name
- Cannot efficiently support multiple teams
- Creates portal "mess" with half-created views
- Forces complete dependency on support timeline
- Previous support inconsistency created "panic moment" during critical campaign
- Prevents confident self-service management

**00:16:05 - Issue #3: Leads Object Isolation**
Leads object lacks full functionality, preventing list creation and Sales Workspace adoption.

- Cannot create lists from leads object
- Leads feel "very isolated" and disconnected
- Company not using leads due to limitations
- Missing out on Sales Workspace features
- Cannot use custom lead status fields in new leads functionality
- Target markets and leads don't connect as expected
- Leads in "weird halfway house" - appear to be object but lack full capabilities

**00:18:06 - Issue #4: Cross-Platform Inconsistencies**
Activities and other objects have limited functionality compared to core objects.

- Activities object has unexpected limitations
- Often promises capability then discovers it's not available
- Must export reports as spreadsheets instead of creating lists
- Forces teams to work outside HubSpot for basic tasks
- Workarounds feel "hacky" even when they provide needed data

**00:18:40 - Issue #5: Perception of HubSpot**
Platform growth without consolidation makes HubSpot feel disconnected and overwhelming.

- Platform feels "too big" without consolidation period
- Sense of "running before you can walk"
- Internal disconnects filter down to customers
- Left sidebar is "huge and disparate"
- Easy to get lost and not understand how things intersect
- Things don't intersect the way platform seems designed for them to
- Undermines HubSpot's core unified data value proposition

**00:21:02 - Next Steps: Executive Panel Invitation**
Invitation to present issues to HubSpot leadership on November 20th.

- Hannah invites Emma to customer panel with HubSpot executives
- Will be one-on-one format (10-45 minutes)
- Time: 11am-12:15pm Eastern (4pm-5:15pm UK)
- Emma agrees to participate
- Will demonstrate specific examples with screen sharing

**00:23:05 - Closing: Feedback Value**
Current feedback sprint at HubSpot, confirmation that customer feedback is read and acted upon.

- HubSpot running cross-product feedback sprint in Q4
- Multiple channels being monitored (CSM, ideas forum, NPS)
- Focus on addressing "sharp edges" across different areas
- Emma appreciates knowing feedback is read and valued
- Specific customer examples help drive urgency for solutions
