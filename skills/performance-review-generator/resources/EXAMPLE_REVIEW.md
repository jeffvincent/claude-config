# Performance Review: Grace Fisher - 2026 H1

## Look Back: Key Achievements in 2025

Grace had a strong year, delivering significant impact across data governance, AI platform development, and cross-functional leadership. Her work demonstrated clear execution at the SPM I level, with several instances of operating at the next level.

**Data Quality & Governance Platform**: Grace led the design and delivery of the enterprise data quality framework, partnering with Engineering and Data Platform teams to establish monitoring, alerting, and remediation workflows. This directly addressed a critical gap in our data infrastructure, reducing data incidents by 40% in Q4. In our 1:1s, I observed her navigating complex technical tradeoffs and building consensus across stakeholders with different priorities. This demonstrates GPS Success Behaviors in Complexity and Collaborative Teamwork at the SPM I level.

**AI/ML Platform Feature Development**: Grace shipped three major ML platform features in 2025: automated model monitoring, feature store integration, and experiment tracking. Each feature required deep technical partnership with ML Engineers and Data Scientists. What stood out was her ability to translate technical requirements into clear product strategy, shown when she presented the ML platform roadmap to senior leadership in Q3. This reflects strong Domain Expertise and Execution.

**Cross-Functional Leadership**: Grace consistently brought HEART values to life, particularly Humble and Empathetic. In our 1:1s, we discussed several situations where she navigated difficult stakeholder conversations with grace and transparency. For example, when the data quality project slipped due to engineering capacity, she proactively communicated delays, proposed alternatives, and maintained trust with partners. This showed maturity in Accountability and Drives for Results.

**Strategic Thinking**: Grace demonstrated growth in strategic thinking this year. She initiated the "Data Platform Strategy 2026" doc without prompting, synthesizing input from 15+ stakeholders and presenting a clear 3-year vision. This is an example of operating at the next level—taking ownership of strategy, not just execution.

## Growth: Strengths and Growth Areas

**Strengths:**

1. **Technical Depth & Credibility**: Grace's ability to dive deep into technical details while maintaining product perspective is a clear strength. Engineers respect her technical judgment, which accelerates decision-making. In our 1:1s, I've seen examples of her debugging data pipeline issues alongside engineers and asking the right architectural questions. This is a GPS strength in Domain Expertise and Skill.

2. **Stakeholder Management**: Grace has a natural ability to build relationships and navigate complexity. She's particularly strong at understanding what different stakeholders need and finding win-win solutions. Her work with the Data Science team on feature prioritization is a great example—she balanced their research needs with platform scalability constraints, and both teams felt heard.

**Growth Area:**

Grace's key growth opportunity for 2026 is **influencing without authority at the executive level**. She's strong at cross-functional collaboration with peers, but I want to see her step into more senior forums and drive strategic conversations. In our recent 1:1s, we discussed opportunities to present at leadership reviews, write strategic memos for exec audiences, and build relationships with Director+ stakeholders. Grace has made progress here—her presentation to the VP of Engineering in December was well-received—and continuing to develop this skill will position her well for future career growth.

## Look Ahead: Q1 2026 Goals

For Q1 2026, Grace's top priorities are:

1. **Launch Enterprise Data Catalog**: Ship v1 of the data catalog with metadata management, search, and lineage tracking. Success looks like 80% of critical datasets cataloged and 50+ weekly active users from across Product, Data Science, and Analytics. This supports the broader Data Platform strategy and addresses a top-3 org need.

2. **AI Platform Roadmap & Strategy**: Finalize the H1-H2 2026 AI Platform roadmap with input from ML Engineering, Data Science, and Product leadership. We'll measure success by stakeholder alignment (no major objections from key partners) and exec approval by end of Q1. In our recent 1:1s, we discussed positioning this as a strategic initiative, not just a feature list.

3. **Build Executive Presence**: Present at one senior leadership forum (Director+ audience) per month. The expected outcome is increased visibility with exec stakeholders and demonstrated ability to influence strategic decisions. This aligns with Grace's growth area and career development goals.

## Performance Rating

**Rating**: 4 - Exceeds Expectations

**Rationale**: Grace consistently exceeded expectations in 2025, delivering high-impact work across data governance and AI platform development. She demonstrated GPS Success Behaviors at the SPM I level and showed instances of operating at the next level (strategic thinking, exec presentations). Her continued growth in executive influence will be key to reaching SPM II.

**Character count**: 4,487/4,500

**GPS dimensions addressed**: Complexity, Collaborative Teamwork, Domain Expertise, Execution, Accountability, Drives for Results, Skill

**Manager notes**: Grace is on track for promotion consideration in H2 2026 if she continues to demonstrate strategic leadership and executive influence. Strong candidate for high-visibility projects.

## What Makes This Example Effective

### Voice and Perspective
- Written in **manager's voice**: "In our 1:1s, I observed..."
- Uses manager's observations: "What stood out was her ability to..."
- References coaching conversations: "In our recent 1:1s, we discussed..."

### Specificity
- **Concrete examples**: "reducing data incidents by 40% in Q4"
- **Named projects**: "Data Quality & Governance Platform", "AI/ML Platform Feature Development"
- **Specific behaviors**: "she proactively communicated delays, proposed alternatives"

### GPS Alignment
- Maps achievements to GPS Success Behaviors
- References HUB level: "at the SPM I level"
- Identifies next-level behaviors: "operating at the next level"

### Balance
- **2 strengths : 1 growth area** ratio
- Growth area is developmental, not punitive
- Forward-looking with actionable next steps

### Measurable Goals
- **Q1 Goal 1**: "80% of critical datasets cataloged and 50+ weekly active users"
- **Q1 Goal 2**: "stakeholder alignment... and exec approval by end of Q1"
- **Q1 Goal 3**: "one senior leadership forum... per month"

### Cultural Alignment
- References HEART values: "Humble and Empathetic"
- Shows how culture comes to life in specific behaviors

### Character Count
- **4,487 characters** - just under the 4,500 limit
- Concise but comprehensive
- Preserved key examples while staying within constraint

## Common Patterns to Follow

1. **Achievement structure**: [What] + [Context] + [Impact] + [GPS mapping]
2. **Strength structure**: [Strength name] + [Specific examples] + [GPS dimension]
3. **Growth area structure**: [Area] + [Coaching context] + [Progress made] + [Future benefit]
4. **Goal structure**: [What] + [Success metrics] + [Strategic alignment]

## Voice Examples

**Manager voice (correct):**
- "In our 1:1s, I observed..."
- "Grace demonstrated..."
- "What stood out was..."
- "I've seen examples of..."

**Employee voice (incorrect for manager review):**
- "I delivered..."
- "I accomplished..."
- "My key achievements were..."

**Generic voice (avoid):**
- "Grace is a great PM"
- "She did well this year"
- "Grace met expectations"

Use the manager voice consistently throughout the review.
