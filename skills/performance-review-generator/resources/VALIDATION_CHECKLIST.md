# Performance Review Validation Checklist

Use this checklist before finalizing and submitting a performance review.

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] **Character count under 4,500** (HubSpot system constraint)
  - Run: `wc -m reviews/{YYYY-HX}/{firstname}-{lastname}-{YYYY-HX}.md`
  - If over limit, condense while preserving key examples

- [ ] **File saved to correct path**: `reviews/{YYYY-HX}/{firstname}-{lastname}-{YYYY-HX}.md`

- [ ] **Frontmatter complete** with all required fields:
  - person, role, hub_level, review_cycle, review_date, manager, performance_rating

## Voice and Perspective

- [ ] **Written in manager's voice** (not employee's self-review voice)
  - Uses "I observed...", "In our 1:1s...", "I've seen..."
  - NOT "I accomplished...", "I delivered..." (that's employee voice)

- [ ] **Grounded in documented observations**
  - Every major point references 1:1 notes or Glean data
  - No vague generalizations without supporting examples

- [ ] **Self-review used as cross-check only**
  - Not copied verbatim from employee's self-review
  - Manager's independent assessment based on observations

## Content Quality

- [ ] **Specific examples from 1:1 notes included**
  - At least 3-5 concrete examples with context
  - Examples show patterns, not one-off events

- [ ] **GPS Success Behaviors referenced**
  - Achievements mapped to appropriate GPS dimensions
  - HUB-level expectations explicitly mentioned
  - See: `/global-resources/performance-expectations-by-level.md`

- [ ] **Measurable impact included**
  - Metrics, outcomes, or scope provided where possible
  - "Delivered X which resulted in Y" not just "Delivered X"

## Growth Areas

- [ ] **Growth areas are developmental** (not punitive)
  - Framed as opportunities for growth, not criticisms
  - Forward-looking with actionable next steps
  - Reflect coaching conversations from 1:1s

- [ ] **Growth feedback is balanced**
  - 2 strengths : 1 growth area ratio
  - Growth area is specific and actionable
  - Connected to career development goals

## Q1 Goals

- [ ] **Q1 goals have measurable success criteria**
  - Each goal includes "success looks like..." or metrics
  - NOT vague ("improve X") but specific ("achieve Y by Z date")

- [ ] **Goals align with team/org priorities**
  - Show connection to broader objectives
  - Reflect manager's strategic priorities

- [ ] **Goals reference recent 1:1 conversations**
  - "In our recent 1:1s, we discussed..."
  - Shows continuity from coaching discussions

## Performance Rating

- [ ] **Performance rating included** (1-5 scale)

- [ ] **Rating rationale provided**
  - 1-2 sentences explaining the rating
  - Based on achievements, GPS alignment, growth trajectory

- [ ] **Rating aligns with review content**
  - A "4" should have clear evidence of exceeding expectations
  - A "3" should show solid performance at level
  - Rating should not surprise the employee (discussed in 1:1s)

## Cultural Alignment

- [ ] **HEART values referenced** (HubSpot Culture Commitments)
  - Humble
  - Empathetic
  - Adaptable
  - Remarkable
  - Transparent

- [ ] **Shows how achievements brought culture to life**
  - Not just "what" but "how"
  - Behavioral examples of culture in action

## GPS Framework Coverage

Check which GPS dimensions are addressed:

**Foundational:**
- [ ] Skill
- [ ] Complexity
- [ ] Supervision
- [ ] Domain Expertise
- [ ] Execution
- [ ] Discretionary Impact

**Impact:**
- [ ] Accountability
- [ ] Drives for Results

**Agility:**
- [ ] Collaborative Teamwork
- [ ] Navigating Change

**People Leadership** (if applicable):
- [ ] Build & Develop Teams
- [ ] Manages Performance
- [ ] Engages Team

**Target**: Address at least 4-6 GPS dimensions relevant to the role.

## Final Checks

- [ ] **No typos or grammatical errors**

- [ ] **Tone is professional and supportive**
  - Celebrates wins, constructive on growth areas
  - Reflects the relationship built in 1:1s

- [ ] **No sensitive or confidential information**
  - Performance reviews are shared beyond manager/employee
  - Avoid details that could violate confidentiality

- [ ] **Ready to share with employee**
  - Would you be comfortable discussing this in person?
  - Does it reflect conversations you've already had?

## Pre-Submission Checklist

Before submitting the review to HubSpot's system:

1. [ ] Read aloud to check flow and tone
2. [ ] Compare against HUB-level expectations document
3. [ ] Verify all claims are supported by evidence
4. [ ] Share draft with employee for their review (if your process includes this)
5. [ ] Sleep on it and re-read with fresh eyes
6. [ ] Confirm character count one final time

## Common Issues to Avoid

- ❌ Copying employee's self-review verbatim
- ❌ Generic praise without specific examples
- ❌ Growth areas that feel like surprises (should be discussed in 1:1s)
- ❌ Goals without measurable success criteria
- ❌ Missing GPS framework alignment
- ❌ Over 4,500 characters
- ❌ Rating doesn't match review content

## Quick Reference: Rating Guidelines

| Rating | Description | Review Content Should Show |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **5** | Exceptional | Operating at next level, consistently exceeds, transformative impact |
| **4** | Exceeds | Regularly exceeds expectations, strong performer, clear impact |
| **3** | Meets | Consistently meets all expectations, solid performer at level |
| **2** | Partially Meets | Meets some but not all expectations, clear gaps identified |
| **1** | Does Not Meet | Significant performance concerns, not meeting level expectations |

**Remember**: The review should never surprise the employee. Everything in the review should have been discussed in 1:1s throughout the year.
