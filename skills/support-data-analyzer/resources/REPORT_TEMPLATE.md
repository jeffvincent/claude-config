## Section Usage Guidelines

### Required Sections (Always Include)
1. Title and metadata
2. Executive Summary
3. Detailed Analysis by Priority (at least P0 and P1)
4. Strategic Recommendations
5. Methodology
6. Appendix: Data Summary

### Optional Sections (Include If Data Available)
1. CSAT Analysis - if CSAT survey data provided
2. Top Customer Requests - if Ideas Forum data provided
3. Comparison vs. Historical - if baseline data provided for trend analysis
4. Top Customer Voices - if rich qualitative feedback available
5. Frustration Heatmap - if frustration data available for most themes

### Adaptation Notes

**For 60-Day Analysis:**
- Use P0 threshold: ≥150 issues
- Emphasize trends and "NEW to top X" themes
- Include CSAT if available (often concurrent with 60-day window)

**For Historical/All-Time Analysis:**
- Use P0 threshold: ≥1,000 issues
- Focus on volume distribution and MRR impact
- Less emphasis on trends (unless comparing to prior year)

**For Focused Analysis (Single Product Area):**
- Reduce priority levels to P0, P1, P2 only
- More detailed examples (7-10 per P0)
- Add "Related Themes" section showing cross-product dependencies

## Formatting Guidelines

### Numbers and Percentages
- **Whole numbers**: Use commas for thousands (1,234)
- **Percentages**: One decimal place (27.5%)
- **Money**: Use K/M notation ($141K, $5.8M)
- **Frustration**: Two decimal places (3.38/5)

### Tables
- Use markdown tables for structured data
- Keep column widths reasonable (<50 chars)
- Right-align numbers, left-align text

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for metrics, theme names, key findings
- *Italic* for section descriptors
- `Code` for property names, technical terms
- ⚠️ for high frustration indicators (≥3.5/5)
- ↑/↓ for trends (increase/decrease)

### Customer Quotes
- Use blockquotes (>)
- Truncate to ~200-300 characters if needed
- Keep original language (don't fix typos/grammar)
- Include attribution context (Frustration, MRR) above quote

### Section Breaks
- Use `---` horizontal rules between major sections
- Use blank lines liberally for readability
- Keep nesting to 4 levels max (####)
